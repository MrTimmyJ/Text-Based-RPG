## Overview

This is a text-based role-playing game (RPG) built in Java that allows players to explore a series of interconnected rooms in a house.
Each room contains items that can be picked up or dropped, and rooms may have unique mechanics (such as healing).
Players can navigate using typed commands and manage an inventory system.

🧩 Features

    🧍 Player creation and inventory system

    🧭 Room navigation with cardinal directions (north, south, east, west)

    🪑 Dynamic room objects and interactions

    🛏️ Special rooms (e.g., Sleep Room that heals the player)

    🛠️ Command-based interaction system (like look, inventory, pick up)

    📦 Utility class for modular string-based item management


🎮 Gameplay

You begin by entering a room and are prompted with command options. Each action affects the game's state.

### Available Commands:

| Command     | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `look`      | List all visible items in the room             |
| `inventory` | Check what items you're currently carrying     |
| `go <dir>`  | Move to a new room (where `<dir>` is n/e/s/w)  |
| `pick up`   | Pick up an item from the room                  |
| `drop`      | Drop an item from your inventory into the room |
| `exits`     | Show all available exits from the current room |
| `help`      | Show help menu with commands                   |
| `quit`      | Exit the game                                  |
